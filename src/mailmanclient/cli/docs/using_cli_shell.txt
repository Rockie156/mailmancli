The Mailman Command Line Shell
==============================

This document describes the usage of the Mailman Command line
shell, using which you can query a mailman installation with ease.

Firing and Exiting the Shell
============================

You can start the mailman shell by executing the mmclient command,
without any arguments

    $ ./mmclient
    Mailman Command Line Interface
    >>>

To exit the shell, use the EOF character, that is, Ctrl + d.

Displaying Mailman Objects
==========================

The shell can be used to display the mailman objects, using the show
command.

For example
    show users
    show domains
    show lists

Further, the CLI supports filtering of mailman objects based upon their
attribute values or properties, using a `where` clause. For this, the CLI 
employs 3 filters, which are

    =        Equality
    like     Case insensitive regular exp mathcing
    in       Search inside a property which list

These filteres can be used in conjunction by using an `and` clause

Examples:
    show users where display_name = Foo
    show users where display_name like .*Foo*
    show lists where foo@bar.com in moderators
    show lists where foo@bar.com in moderators and a@b.com in owners

The Shell Environment
======================

The shell provides a facility to create variables that can be used to
make the querying easier.

For using the shell, two commands, `set` and `unset` are used.

Example
  set useremail foo@bar.com

The variables can be used in the queries as follows
  show lists where $useremail in moderators

The `$username` will be replaced with the value of `useremail`
